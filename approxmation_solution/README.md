Class 1: For the approximation, I will be greedy by selecting the best choice at that time by selecting a variable in the current valuse to be True of False in order to satisfy the clause, and if there is more than one variable available, I will randomly pick one of the variables to make True or False to satisfy the clause.

Class 2: Wrote the approximation by randomly assigning True or False to each variable and looping through each clause checking if the caluse is valid. 

Class 3: Reworking approximation to not randomly reassign all variables when looking for a better solution.

# I will be reducing the Max3SAT problem to the Independent Set and write an approximation for Independent Set. 
# I will be starting by editing the input for the Lab 17, and perform conversion from 3Sat sentence to a graph.
# I will draw edges between contradicting variables (like 1 and -1)
# I will run independent set on ALL possible vertice combinations and save the best result 
# I will also be keeping track of the runtime

Importance of the NP-hard Problem:

    Max 3-SAT is an NP-hard optimization problem, meaning it has no known polynomial-time solution unless ùëÉ=ùëÅùëÉ. 
    This makes it a critical benchmark for testing optimization algorithms, heuristics, and approximation techniques.

Applications:
    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:

        Reasoning and Inference:
            Max 3-SAT is often used in AI systems for logical reasoning and decision-making, such as designing systems that infer conclusions from a large number of rules.
        
        Feature Selection:
            In machine learning, Boolean formulas can model the relationship between features and outcomes. Max 3-SAT optimizations are used to select a subset of features that satisfy the most constraints.
    
    Circuit Design and Verification:

        Logic Circuit Optimization:
            Circuit design involves ensuring that logical components operate as intended. Max 3-SAT helps in minimizing unsatisfied logical constraints during optimization.
